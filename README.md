# Typing Test

## Overview
This project is a simple typing test application designed to measure typing speed and accuracy. It was developed as part of a software development course to practice Java programming and basic web development skills.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

- **TP_part3/**
  - **TypingTest.java**: The main Java file containing the logic for the typing test.
  - **index.html**: The HTML file that provides the user interface for the typing test.
  - **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the HTML interface.

## TypingTest.java
This file contains the core functionality of the typing test application. Key components include:

- **Main Method**: Initializes the application and starts the typing test.
- **Methods**: Various methods to handle user input, calculate typing speed, and measure accuracy.
- **Data Structures**: Used to store the text to be typed and track user progress.

### Key Features
- **Start Test**: Begins the typing test and displays the text to be typed.
- **Track Keystrokes**: Monitors user input and compares it to the target text.
- **Calculate Results**: Computes typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy percentage.
- **Display Results**: Shows the user's performance at the end of the test.

## index.html
This file serves as the user interface for the typing test. It includes:

- **Input Field**: Where users type the given text.
- **Start Button**: To initiate the typing test.
- **Result Display**: Shows typing speed and accuracy after the test is completed.

## styles.css
This file contains the styling for the HTML interface, making it visually appealing and easy to use. Key styles include:

- **Layout**: Arranges elements on the page for a clean and organized look.
- **Typography**: Defines fonts and text sizes for readability.
- **Colors**: Uses a color scheme to enhance the user experience.

## How to Run the Project
